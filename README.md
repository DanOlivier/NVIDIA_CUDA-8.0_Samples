# NVIDIA_CUDA-8.0_Samples

This is a copy of the samples published along with the NVidia CUDA Toolkit.

My contribution is to rationalize the makefiles.
This began primarily as a robotic substitution, but evolved into a rather extensive refactoring.

Ultimately, it might have been preferable to start from scratch with CMake (or other build or meta-build program)

YMMV
